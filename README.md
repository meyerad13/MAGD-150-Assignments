##### In Assignment 1 we were required to use some of the shapes that we had learned throughout the first week of class. Using shapes such as rectangles, ellipses, lines, and points, I chose to draw a picture of a cow being abducted by a spaceship. We were also required to use different rectMode's and ellipseMode's.

##### Assignment 2 was all about color. We were required to draw a balloon themed sketch using three different ways to introduce color into it. I chose to create a hot air balloon floating in the sky.

##### Assignment 3 focused on math. We were required to use four math key words, four operators or comparisons, and at least three math functions that are in the processing library. We also had to stick to the theme of bubbles for our sketch. I chose to do a sketch of bubbles floating up through water. While floating, the bubbles would change color. They also would reappear and start rising from the bottom again when they reached the top. I also added a fish that moves around by the coordinates of the mouse.

##### Assignment 4 was focused on dynamism. This sketch was required to have some sort of animation upon running the sketch. Mouse interactions, keyboard interactions, and three conditional statements were also required. Our theme for Assignment 4 was oceans (of pizza). I chose to do an ocean that had a constant wave animation. I also added pieces of pizza floating on top of the waves. I added mouse interactions that put a face on moon depending on left or right mouse clicks. I also added keyboard interactions that places the word pizza on the screen after any button is clicked.

##### Assignment 5 was focused on intersections. We were required to create both a circuar and rectanglular button that triggered an event when clicked. The buttons also required text labels. Our theme for assignment 5 was Menus to an alternate dimension. I chose to create 2 buttons that brought the user to two entirely different experiences. The first when clicked brought you to a spaceship fflying through space a warp speed. The second was a boat floating in water.
