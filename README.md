##### In Assignment 1 we were required to use some of the shapes that we had learned throughout the first week of class. Using shapes such as rectangles, ellipses, lines, and points, I chose to draw a picture of a cow being abducted by a spaceship. We were also required to use different rectMode's and ellipseMode's.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/meyerad13/MAGD-150-Assignments/edit/gh-pages/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
